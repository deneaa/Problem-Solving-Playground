# Problem Solving Playground

Welcome to the **Problem Solving Playground**! This is where I practice my programming skills by solving problems from **LeetCode** and other coding platforms.

## ðŸ“Œ About this Repository

In this repository, you will find my solutions to various algorithm and data structure problems, along with optimizations for each approach I take.

## ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Source code** for my solutions to problems from LeetCode and other coding challenges.
- **Multiple approaches** for the same problem, including brute-force and optimized solutions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Improve my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Practice various concepts such as recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking, etc.
- Prepare for technical interviews and programming competitions.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository?

1. Explore the files to see my solutions.
2. Try solving the problems on your own and compare your approach with mine.
3. Test the solutions and attempt to optimize them.

ðŸ“Œ **This repository is constantly updated, so new problems and solutions will be added regularly!**

## ðŸ¤” Have a Better Solution?

If you think thereâ€™s a better or more optimized solution to any of the problems, feel free to reach out! Iâ€™m open to suggestions, feedback, and collaboration.
